//## Counter without setInterval

//Without using setInterval, try to code a counter in Javascript. There is a hint at the bottom of the file if you get stuck.

count2=0
setTimeout(counter2,1000)

function counter2(){
    console.clear()
    count2=count2+1
    console.log(count2)
    setTimeout(counter2,1000)
}

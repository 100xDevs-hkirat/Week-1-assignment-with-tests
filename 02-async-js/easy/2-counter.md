## Counter without setInterval

Without using setInterval, try to code a counter in Javascript. There is a hint at the bottom of the file if you get stuck.

var counter = 1;
function counterSolve(){
    console.clear();
    console.log(counter);
    counter++;
    setTimeOut(counterSolver, 1000);
}
setTimeOut(counterSolver, 1000);








































































(Hint: setTimeout)
